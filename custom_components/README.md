# Home Assistant Configuration

This repository contains my personal Home Assistant configuration, including:

- YAML-mode Lovelace dashboards
- A custom integration for Donetick chores
- Automations, themes, and UI layouts
- Git-managed and modular file structure

## Features

- **Family Dashboard**: A visual dashboard showing meals and chores using `auto-entities` and `atomic-calendar-revive`
- **Donetick Integration**: Custom component to display chores as sensors and mark them complete with button entities
- **Modular Structure**: Config files organized into folders for clarity and reuse
- **Custom Cards**: Uses community cards like `layout-card`, `template-entity-row`, and more
